#Week 3: use Node.js to create a social media feed
##Time: one week

We will be building a Node.js application to access various social media APIs to collect posts for displaying on each of your blogs.

The initial task will be to create a gallery of tweeted images with the hashtag #FoundersandCoders on your blog, using the Twitter API and an application that responds to AJAX requests by serving JSON.

If you successfully complete this task, there are a number of possible extension tasks that you can attempt:

Create a real-time feed that automatically updates your page when new data is posted to Twitter;
Store older tweets locally, so that when they are too old to be retrieved directly from the API, they can be retrieved locally;
Use the Instagram API and display images from two different sources in the same page;
There are several questions that you will have to answer to successfully complete this week's task:

*What is Node.js and how does it work;
*What Node.js modules might there be to help us with this task;
*How can we access the Twitter API;
*How can we ensure that our API credentials are not shared publicly on GitHub;
*How can we extract image URLs from the Twitter feed;
*How can we repurpose the Twitter data to create our own data feed;
*How can we extract that data to display on the page;
*How can we make a nice-looking gallery page;
*How far back do tweets served by the Twitter API go;
*How can we store and extract data locally;
*How can we extract data from the Instagram API;
*How can we nicely combine data from two different sources;
*Where can we serve our application from?
